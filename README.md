<h1>GuessCR</h1>

GuessCR is a singlepage HTML-based game where players have to guess the correct card from Clash Royale using the blurred image provided.
GuessCR uses RoyaleAPI, which requires a Supercell Developer API Key: https://developer.clashroyale.com/#/

In order for the game to connect to the API, the ```token``` variable in the scripts.js file must be set to a valid Supercell API key in string form.
